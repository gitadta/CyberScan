## ðŸ§ª Simulated Asset Discovery

The `AI â€“ Process Assets` node uses placeholder asset data (e.g., `10.0.0.1`, `host-a`) to simulate internal devices.

This ensures:

- No real IP addresses or hostnames are exposed
- The workflow remains fully functional for testing and demonstration
- Users can replace this with real asset discovery logic or data sources

Feel free to modify this node to load assets from a database, API, or environment variable in production.
